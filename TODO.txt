Laundry list of future tasks, in no particular order:

 - AIML 1.0.1 compliance (highest priority):
   - Add support for multiple stars in patterns (and the subsequent "x,y"
     format of the "index" attribute of star, thatstar, and topicstar
     elements.
   - Unknown yet well-defined elements (e.g. HTML) inside templates
     (see sections 3.2, 3.6).
   - formalize whitespace handling (sees section 2.10).
   - AimlParser._validateElemStart() needs to test the well-formedness of
     attribute values (for example, making sure that the "index" attribute
     has an integer value, and not a string).
 - Support the Program D startup file syntax, or something similar?  It
   seems to be a good way to initialize bot settings and substitutions.
 - Documentation/tutorials.
