Laundry list of future tasks, in no particular order:

 - AimlParser._validateElemStart() needs to test the well-formedness of
   attribute values (for example, making sure that the "index" attribute
   has an integer value, and not a string).
 - Support the Program D startup file syntax, or something similar?  It seems to
   be a good way to initialize bot settings and substitutions.
 - Documentation/tutorials.
 - Add support for multiple stars in patterns (and the subsequent "x,y" format
   of the "index" attribute of star, thatstar, and topicstar elements.  This
   is really the last thing that stands in the way of AIML 1.0.1 compliance!
