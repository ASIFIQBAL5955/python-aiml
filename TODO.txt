Laundry list of future tasks, in no particular order:

 - AimlParser._validateElemStart() needs to test the well-formedness of
   attribute values (for example, making sure that the "index" attribute
   has an integer value, and not a string).
 - Support the Program D startup file syntax, or something similar?  It seems to
   be a good way to initialize bot settings and substitutions.
 - Documentation/tutorials.
