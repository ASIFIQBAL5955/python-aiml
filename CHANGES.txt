version 0.2
 - 50% speedup in Kernel.loadBrain() and Kernel.saveBrain().
 - The optional 'learnFiles' and 'commands' arguments to
   Kernel.bootstrap() can now be either strings or lists. This
   allows multiple files/commands to be loaded during
   initialization.
 - Added support for <person> and <person2> tags.
 - Added general word-substitution functionality.  This opens up
   the potential for localizing PyAIML into non-English languages.
   See DefaultSubs.py for more info.
