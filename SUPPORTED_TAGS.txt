This document describes the current state of PyAIML's compliance
to the AIML 1.0 standard.  The full AIML reference manual can be
found online at http://www.alicebot.org/documentation/aiml-reference.html

The following tags are currently supported:

<bot name="name"> (see notes)
<condition>
<date>
<formal>
<gender>
<get>
<input>
<learn>
<li>
<lowercase>
<person>
<person2>
<random>
<sentence>
<set>
<size>
<sr>
<srai>
<star> (see notes)
<system> (see notes)
<that> (both inside patterns and inside categories)
<think>
<uppercase>
<version>

Support for the following tags should be implemented in the next version:

<thatstar>

The following tags are not supported:

<gossip>
<id>
<if>/<else>
<javascript> (see notes)
<secure> (see notes)
<topic>
<topicstar>

------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES ON SPECIFIC TAGS:

<bot name="name">
To set the bot's name, use Kernel.setBotName("NewName").  Note that the
name *MUST* be a single word!  Use Kernel.getBotName() to query the bot's
name in your code.

<javascript>
Support for the JavaScript tag is not anticipated; one of the design
goals of PyAIML is to remain 100% pure standard Python.  So until
somebody writes a JavaScript interpreter in Python, PyAIML won't
support the <javascript> tag.  On the bright side, it is possible
to simulate the effects of the <javascript> tag (i.e. dynamically-
generated tag contents) using the <system mode="sync"> tag.  This
solution has the added advantage of allowing *any* programming
language to be used, not just JavaScript.

<secure>
Some AIML implementations support a non-standard <secure> tag, intended to
wrap parts of a template which should only be processed if the user is
"secure", or trusted.  After implementing support for this tag, I realized
that it wasn't doing anything that you can't do with the <condition> tag.
Therefore, I've decided to drop support for the <secure> tag.  You can
easily duplicate its effects; simply replace this:
	<secure error="you're not allowed">you are allowed</secure>
with this:
	<condition name="secure">
		<li value="yes">you are allowed</li>
		<li>you are not allowed</li>
	</condition>
Then, use the Kernel.setPredicate() call to set the "secure" predicate to
"yes" for any session that you wish to be secure.

<star>
The star tag takes an optional "index" attribute, specifying which
star in the pattern to expand and return.  However, the AIML reference
seems to specify that there can only be one * in a given pattern,
and PyAIML adheres to this restriction.  Therefore, index values other
than 1 are meaningless (and ignored).

<system>
PyAIML supports a non-standard "mode" attribute in <system> tags.
The value of the mode attribute can be either "async" or "sync"
(the default).  Sync-mode implements the behavior described in
the AIML Reference Manual.  Async-mode causes the specified
command to be run in a separate process; the interpreter returns
immediately, and does not capture the output of the spawned
sub-process.
