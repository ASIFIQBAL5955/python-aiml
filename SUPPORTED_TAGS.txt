This document describes the current state of PyAIML's compliance
to the AIML 1.0 standard.  The full AIML reference manual can be
found online at http://www.alicebot.org/documentation/aiml-reference.html

The following tags are currently supported:

<condition>
<date>
<formal>
<gender>
<get>
<learn>
<li>
<lowercase>
<random>
<sentence>
<set>
<size>
<srai>
<system> (see notes)
<think>
<uppercase>
<version>

Support for the following tags should be implemented in the next version:

<input>
<person>
<person2>
<star>
<that>

The following tags are not supported:

<gossip>
<id>
<if>/<else>
<javascript> (see notes)
<sr>
<thatstar>
<topic>
<topicstar>

NOTES ON SPECIFIC TAGS:

<javascript>
Support for the JavaScript tag is not anticipated; one of the design
goals of PyAIML is to remain 100% pure standard Python.  So until
somebody writes a JavaScript interpreter in Python, PyAIML won't
support the <javascript> tag.  On the bright side, it is possible
to simulate the effects of the <javascript> tag (i.e. dynamically-
generated tag contents) using the <system mode="sync"> tag.  This
solution has the added advantage of allowing *any* programming
language to be used, not just JavaScript.

<system>
PyAIML supports a non-standard "mode" attribute in <system> tags.
The value of the mode attribute can be either "async" or "sync"
(the default).  Sync-mode implements the behavior described in
the AIML Reference Manual.  Async-mode causes the specified
command to be run in a separate process; the interpreter returns
immediately, and does not capture the output of the spawned
sub-process.
